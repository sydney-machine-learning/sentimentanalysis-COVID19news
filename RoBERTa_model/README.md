# RoBERTa model part:
This part is the RoBERTa model. Among them, RoBERTa_model.ipynb contains the 
preprocessing and model adjustment of the RoBERTa model. Since the overall labeled 
data is relatively large, we divided it into sections according to the section name: 
Australia news, UK news, World news and Opinion.

Because our adjusted model is about 400MB, we use Google Drive to store it.
Here is the fine_tuned RoBERTa model:

Our labelled Guardian data is also very large and is stored in the Google Drive link below. 
We have also prepared versions classified according to different sections, 
namely Australia news, UK news, World news and Opinion.
Here is Robertaâ€™s version of the labeled Guardian data:
